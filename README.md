# ADSL-Study-Group-Graph

## Introduction
This is the hands-on code for graph neural networks in NYCU ADSL study group designed by [Chih-Chia Li](https://github.com/karljackab).
The goal of the study group is to help understand the concept of graph neural networks and how to model complex data as a graph.
Beside the implementation part, we will study Stanford University course: [CS224W - Machine Learning with Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/index.html)
